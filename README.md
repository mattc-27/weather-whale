## 🧠 Inspiration

**Weather Whale** was built with the idea that checking the weather should be simple, beautiful, and informative. Instead of relying on cluttered apps or ad-heavy forecast sites, we wanted a tool that:

- Surfaces key info at a glance
- Highlights changes and trends visually
- Respects the user's time, space, and privacy

It’s weather with a touch of wonder 🐋
